	    <h3 class="cursive">Introduction</h3>
	    <p>I was once told by a wise person that behind every great man is an 
		even better woman in my younger days. They were right, you can even see 
		it in superheroes, Superman has Lois Clark, Luke Cage has Jessica Jones, 
		Spiderman has Mary Jane, and so on and so forth. We give the former all 
		the credit and glory without ever really recognizing the latter, the 
		strong women who support us men in our everyday lives, the real heroes. 
		Andrea is definitely my hero, she may not be able to leap tall buildings 
		in a single bound but she can pick my sorry butt off the pavement when 
		I'm feeling low. My strength daily is always heightened whenever I hear 
		her say "I love you". My speed rivals the Flash whenever she says "I 
		need you" for anything at all from lifting heavy objects to reaching 
		things on a tall shelf. Something about a good woman just can give 
		increased abilities to the weakest of men.</p>
